# algorithms

Some usefull implementations of classical algorithms and data structures.

## heap
Fibonacci heap and binary heap implementations that use dictionaries to access nodes.

## disjoint_set
Efficient implementation of 'find and union' structure with path compression.

## big_number
Big number class that allows all simple operations on integers from any range.

## graph
Classical graph algorithms with classes that can behave like containers and are easy to extend.
